    <h1>Drones are becoming a bigger part of our world</h1>
        <main>
            <p id="mainHeading">As technology advances, so does our understanding of
                how technology affects our lives. Now more than ever are we aquainted to 
                life of instant gratification. But what if I told you drones, as great as
                they are have some unintended consequences. In this article I will go over
                how drones are affecting nature, privacy, and even innocent lives.
            </p>
            <h2>Drones affect nature</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>While drones are a great hobby the noise they make can be very 
                        disorienting to local wildlife. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Not to mention drones actually hurt
                        birds of prey like hawks that mistake them for smaller birds
                        and end up getting hurt by its proppellers.
                    </p>
                    <p>Lastly the sound frequency the propelers of a drone make is very
                        akin to the noise a wasp makes. this can scare off many pollonators
                        like bees and butterflies reducing plant growth.

                <h2>Drones invade privacy and Human life</h2>
                <article>
                    <p class="testP">Drones offer a new way for people and goverments to invade privacy.
                        their have many debates on if flying a drone above someones property 
                        counts as tresspasing. some states have even created laws for these cases
                    </p>
                    <p>When you think of drones being killer death machines your first thought
                        might be of the movie terminator. However UAV's or Unmanned Arial Vehicles 
                        are essentially giant drones with missels. Because UAV's dont risk human life
                        the US militarry uses them a lot more than soilders. The main issue with this 
                        is the US millitary has had more civilian deaths during the time of UAV's than
                        any other point in history.
                    </p>

                    <p>Drones also give another angle for people to counduct terrorist attacks.
                        In fact about a year ago FBI had revoverd a kamakazi drone that was used
                        to attack our power grids. the Original story can be found using

            <p>In conclusion while drones can be used to take great photos. They can also be used for great harm.</p>
